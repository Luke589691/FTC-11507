## Welcome!
This GitHub repository is a fork of FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController, with some extra sample code, file directories explanations and so forth, intended to assist with a transition from block coding to on-bot java coding, and written originally for use in teams:

11505 - Flaming Galahs
11506 - 
25827 - 

## Requirements
To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio 2021.2 (codename Chipmunk) or later.

To program your robot in Blocks or OnBot Java, you do not need Android Studio.

## Getting Started
If you are just starting text coding, please download the pptx file and follow the presentation to setup git, github and android studio along with how to get this repository for yourself.

If your team already has a github repo and you just want to look inside this one and mess around a bit, feel free to fork this repo and do so (also explained in the slides). 

## Sample code
I've added a few starter files so that you do not need to write as much boilerplate, as well as an example utility class that helps explain some of the aspects of java coding.
there is also a Mechanum drive TeleOp example forked from brandon-gong/ftc-mecanum.

### Enjoy!
